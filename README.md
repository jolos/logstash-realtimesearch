A Realtime Search Frontend for logstash
=======================================

This is a very simple frontend for the my [logstash-subscriber](https://github.com/jolos/logstash-subscriber)
currently it's very limited in its functionality and to get it working, you probably need to dig into
the code to figure out why it's not working. Nevertheless it does what it does and provides you
with realtime search of logstash. Logstash already provides an output to websocket, but that doesn't allow you
to search it. 

If you're really really interested in it, you can contact me with questions
